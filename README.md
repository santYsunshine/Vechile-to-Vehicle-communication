Wireless communication systems that include unmanned vehicles promise to provide
cost effective wireless connectivity for devices without infrastructure coverage Compared to
terrestrial communications on high altitude platforms on demand wireless systems with low
altitude UVs are in general faster deploy and more flexibly reconfigured, likely to have better
communication channels due to the presence short range line of sight links However the
utilization of highly mobile , energy constrained UVs for wireless communications also
introduces new challenges. In Vehicle collision avoidance system is automobile system a
safety system that is designed to reduce the chances of collision to achieve this we use V2V
communication and vehicle to infrastructure communication used to minimize the chances
of the accidents In addition to this, for an Electric unmanned vehicle we use Wireless
charging to charge the vehicle with the help of Tesla coil. In this article, we provide an
overview of Unmanned/ Autonomous Electric Vehicle aided wireless communications
introducing the basic networking architecture and main channel characteristics highlighting
the key design considerations as well as the new opportunities to beexploited.
